# Pentesting Work Flow: My Personal Approach to Penetration Testing

At the time of writing this, I am still very much a newbie to offensive security. But the purpose of this document is to 
1. Help me create a personalized workflow for how to approach a pentest or CTF challenge
2. Learn and review the steps of the typical stages of a penetration test that you would typically see in an enterprise environment


Depending on if you are attempting a pentest against a CTF server or a company, some aspects of your approach will be different. Below are the 5 stages that go into a typical penetration test

1. Planning and Reconnaissance
- Enterprise Pentest: 
    - Before a pentest, there are test guidelines drawn up to determine what the focus of the engagement will be and what the rules of engagement are. Once that information is dialed in, then the penetration testing team knows how they need to focus in order to properly test the company that has hired them. 
    - After the team has an understadning of the goals of the engagement, information gathering may involve doing OSINT on the company (Looking up as much as you can on the company/ employees to find what information is readily available using open source searching technology like Google, Shodan, and others) as well as visiting the physical site to check out the layout and get a feel for the buildings' weaknesses. 
    - Here are a list of some of the most popular OSINT tools:

- CTF Challenege: 
    - In a CTF challenge, this phase is more or less debunk. You don't typically need to do any information gathering other than reading the description of the target you are attacking. 
2. Scanning
- In this stage the target company or CTF server are actively scanned using tools like nmap to get an understanding of the technology that is externally facing, and what types of systems are exposed to the outside world. 
- During this phase you should be trying to gather as much information as possible about the technologies used. This includes:
    - Websites: 
        - What kind of webservers are they using?
        - What kinds of languages did they use?
        - What versions of servers/ languages are they using?
        - Any interesting third party libraries? 
    - Servers:
        - What types of servers are being run?
        - Can you identify the OS?
    - Network:
        - What ports are open?
        - Based on open ports, can you determine the services that may be running?
