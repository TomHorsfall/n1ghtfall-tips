# Understanding Compiling GCC

gcc is a command line utility that is used to convert source code to a binary that can then be run on a computer.

When source code is compiled, it is translated to machine code that the CPU can understand.

## What does gcc stand for?

GCC Stands for **GNU Compiler Collection** and can convert C, C++, and Java to binary

## The 4 Steps of Compilation:
1. Preprocessor
2. Compiler
3. Assembler
4. Linker

### 1. Preprocessor
- In the preprocessing stage, GCC examines the source code and processes it by removing **comments, header files, (<stdio.h>), and expanding macro name with code.
    - A macro is basically another word for a variable


### 2. Compile time
- The compiler turns each line in the preprocessed file into assembly language which are instructions in English mnemonics that have strong one to one correspondence to the machine code that computers can read. 
- Compiled files that stop at this stage end with a ".s" extension

### 3. Assemble it all (Assembler)
- Once the file is in assembly language, the assembler then translates it into the object code (or machine language) which consists of pure binary code. 
- If stopped after this stage the code will end with a ".o" extension

### 4. Linker
- This stage serves two purposes:
1. It can take multiple C files and merge it into pne program
2. If the C contains functions from the library, the Linker will extract and connect them to output file
