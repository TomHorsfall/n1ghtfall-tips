##  Purpose 
The purpose of this repo is to act as a living/ breathing study guide for myself as well as other up and coming security professionals. 

Rather than taking notes and keeping them all to myself, I thought this would be a great way for me to learn to articulate what I am learning in my own words.

The goal is to to find resources on various security topics and combine them all into one location. As I grow as a professional, I want to continue to grow this page. 

P.S. VS Code doesn't have spellcheck so I apologize if my grammar and spelling aren't perfect.
