## FTP runs on Port 21 ###

What is an FTP server?
- FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol and it is typically used by organizations to transfer files within or between organizations
- It can be connected to using netcat (nc), telnet, or the ftp command


Steps to determine if FTP is available:
1. Run nmap agains the IP and look for an open port on port 21
2. If it is open, attempt to connect to it via:
  a. ftp <ip address> 
  b. nc -v <ip address> 21
  c. telnet <ip address> 21
3. Using one of these 3 connections, you can determine the version of the FTP server

Once you have the version of FTP you can use a tool like searchsploit to search for vulnerabilities

Example Command:
searchsploit ftp

Or you can use Exploit DB directly:

### Anonymous Login ###

FTP Servers are typically not configured to allow anonymous login BUT every so often somone will forcefully configure a server to allow this.

If this happens a person can connect to the ftp service using a command like so:

ftp <ip address>
USER: anonymous
PASS: anonymous
